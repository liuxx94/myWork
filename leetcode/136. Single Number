Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size = nums.size();
        int result = 0;
        int i = 0;
        for(i = 0; i < size; i ++)
            result ^= nums[i];
        return result;
        
    }
};
